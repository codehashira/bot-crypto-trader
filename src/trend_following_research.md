# Trend Following Strategy Research for Cryptocurrency Trading

## Key Insights from Man Group Research

### Advantages of Trend Following in Cryptocurrency Markets
- Cryptocurrencies offer fertile ground for trend-following due to their inherent liquidity, volatility, and lack of fundamental valuation anchors
- Unlike traditional markets where fundamental analyses provide valuation anchors, cryptocurrency valuations have less fundamental support and fluctuate widely
- This creates pronounced trends that can be exploited by trend-following strategies

### Optimal Portfolio Size
- Peak risk-adjusted returns in a trend-following crypto portfolio occur with around 10-15 coins
- Beyond this point, transaction costs and liquidity constraints outweigh diversification benefits
- For breakout models (which are more reactive), the optimal number is lower, around 10 coins

### Volatility Management
- Volatility scaling is crucial for managing cryptocurrency's high volatility
- Volatility scaling adjusts the invested exposure to the level of volatility, maintaining a stable risk level
- This approach makes Bitcoin trading more "normal" than equity markets in some ways
- Once volatility is scaled, the left tails of Bitcoin are more benign than those of the S&P 500
- Transaction costs are typically reduced in periods of high market stress due to volatility scaling

### Diversification Considerations
- Cryptocurrencies show limited diversification potential with an average pairwise correlation of around 0.6
- While traditional trend-following benefits from trading across diverse markets, crypto has more concentration
- The limited historical data is partially offset by the availability of high-frequency data

## Common Trend Following Techniques for Cryptocurrency

### Moving Average Crossovers
- Using combinations like 200-day vs 50-day moving averages
- Signals are generated when shorter-term MA crosses above/below longer-term MA
- Longer periods reduce false signals but may be slower to react to trend changes

### Breakout Models
- Focus on entering positions when price surpasses established resistance or support levels
- More reactive and generate sharp binary signals
- Enter full long or short positions immediately
- Provide valuable "crisis alpha" by reacting swiftly to market changes
- Require greater liquidity due to their reactive nature

### Implementation Considerations
- Must balance between diversification benefits and trading costs
- Liquidity is ample for top 15 coins but declines significantly thereafter
- Slippage increases dramatically when venturing into altcoin markets
- Transaction costs can outweigh additional diversification benefits beyond optimal portfolio size
